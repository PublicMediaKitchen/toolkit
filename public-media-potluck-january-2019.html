<h1>Public Media Potluck - 2019 - San Francisco</h1>
        <p>Build the next generation of Public Media together at the two day "Public Media Potluck". Share ideas, projects, and stories of success and failure with different public media product teams from around the country. Have a bigger impact by tackling issues facing public media organizations of all sizes and types of digital sophistication. This collective, coordinated effort will ensure you're solving problems that benefit more than just "our team", while also reaping the same efficiency benefits from other products and teams. The goal is to stop reinventing the wheel, at every program and station, to work together more, and to share technology.</p>
        <p>We are in the process of formulating what topics to focus on for this meetup. Please use contact form below to give us suggestions!</p>
        <p>If you'd like to contact the team organizing the Potluck, the best way to do that is via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/JTtFNbSduotdHGhj2">this form</a>.</p>

        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <p>Please note that KQED, 2601 Mariposa Street between Bryant and York Streets in San Francisco's Mission District,  is located in a primarily residential neighborhood, and there are no hotels within close walking distance. Hotels downtown or South of Market (SOMA) are about 15-20 minutes by taxi or rideshare.</p>
        <p>If you want to try to stay closer to KQED, we recommend trying AirBNB.</p>
        <p>Downtown SF: Hotel Zetta, Kimpton Sir Francis Drake</p>
        <p>There is one boutique hotel that is a little closer than downtown, the <a href="http://www.parkerguesthouse.com/">Parker Guest House</a>. As of Dec 11 they still had rooms available, prices per night start at $199.        </p>
        <p>If you are entering addresses in GPS for streets in the Mission District or Downtown that are named with numbers (for example 17th Street), be sure you enter Street and not Avenue. You will end up in a very far away neighborhood if you accidentally use Avenue! </p>
